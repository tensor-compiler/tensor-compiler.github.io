The time it takes to generate code under the hood for performing that computation should not be measured , since this overhead can be quite variable but can often be amortized in practice. By default though, TACO will only generate and compile code it needs for performing a computation immediately before it has to actually perform the computation. As the example above demonstrates, by manually calling the result tensor's compile method, we can tell TACO to generate code needed for performing the computation before benchmarking starts, letting us measure only the performance of the computation itself. Warning pytaco.evaluate and pytaco.einsum should not be used to benchmark TACO's computational performance, since timing those functions will include the time it takes to generate code for performing the computation. The time it takes to construct the initial operand tensors should also not be measured , since again this overhead can often be amortized in practice. By default, pytaco.read and functions for converting NumPy arrays and SciPy matrices to TACO tensors return fully constructed tensors. If you add nonzero elements to an operand tensor by invoking its insert method though, then pack must also be explicitly invoked before any benchmarking is done: import pytaco as pt from pytaco import compressed , dense import numpy as np import random import time csr = pt . format ([ dense , compressed ]) dv = pt . format ([ dense ]) A = pt . read ( \"pwtk.mtx\" , csr ) x = pt . tensor ([ A . shape [ 1 ]], dv ) z = pt . tensor ([ A . shape [ 0 ]], dv ) y = pt . tensor ([ A . shape [ 0 ]], dv ) # Insert random values into x and z and pack them into dense arrays for k in range ( A . shape [ 1 ]): x . insert ([ k ], random . random ()) x . pack () for k in range ( A . shape [ 0 ]): z . insert ([ k ], random . random ()) z . pack () i , j = pt . get_index_vars ( 2 ) y [ i ] = A [ i , j ] * x [ j ] + z [ i ] y . compile () start = time . perf_counter () y . compute () end = time . perf_counter () print ( \"Execution time: {0} seconds\" . format ( end - start )) TACO avoids regenerating code for performing the same computation though as long as the computation is redefined with the same index variables and with the same operand and result tensors. Thus, if your application executes the same computation many times in a loop and if the computation is executed on sufficiently large data sets, TACO will naturally amortize the overhead associated with generating code for performing the computation. In such scenarios, it is acceptable to include the initial code generation overhead in the performance measurement: import pytaco as pt from pytaco import compressed , dense import numpy as np import time csr = pt . format ([ dense , compressed ]) dv = pt . format ([ dense ]) A = pt . read ( \"pwtk.mtx\" , csr ) x = pt . tensor ([ A . shape [ 1 ]], dv ) z = pt . tensor ([ A . shape [ 0 ]], dv ) y = pt . tensor ([ A . shape [ 0 ]], dv ) for k in range ( A . shape [ 1 ]): x . insert ([ k ], random . random ()) x . pack () for k in range ( A . shape [ 0 ]): z . insert ([ k ], random . random ()) z . pack () i , j = pt . get_index_vars ( 2 ) # Benchmark the iterative SpMV computation, including overhead for # generating code in the first iteration to perform the computation start = time . perf_counter () for k in range ( 1000 ): y [ i ] = A [ i , j ] * x [ j ] + z [ i ] y . evaluate () x [ i ] = y [ i ] x . evaluate () end = time . perf_counter () print ( \"Execution time: {0} seconds\" . format ( end - start )) Warning In order to avoid regenerating code for performing a computation, the computation must be redefined with the exact same index variable objects and also with the exact same tensor objects for operands and result. In the example above, every loop iteration redefines the computation of y and x using the same tensor and index variable objects costructed outside the loop, so TACO will only generate code to compute y and x in the first iteration. If the index variables were constructed inside the loop though, TACO would regenerate code to compute y and x in every loop iteration, and the compilation overhead would not be amortized. Note As a rough rule of thumb, if a computation takes on the order of seconds or more in total to perform across all invocations with identical operands and result (and is always redefined with identical index variables), then it is acceptable to include the overhead associated with generating code for performing the computation in performance measurements.","title":"Guide to Benchmarking"},{"location":"computations.html","text":"Specifying Tensor Algebra Computations Tensor algebra computations can be expressed in taco with tensor index notation, which at a high level describes how each element in the output tensor can be computed from elements in the input tensors.

Selecting the Right Tensor Format TACO supports storing tensors in a wide range of formats, including many commonly used ones like dense arrays, compressed sparse row (CSR), and compressed sparse fiber (CSF). Using the right formats to store a sparse computation's operands and result can not only reduce the amount of memory needed to perform the computation but also improve its performance. In particular, by selecting formats that accurately describe the sparsity and structure of the operands, TACO can generate code under the hood that exploits these properties of the data to avoid redundantly computing with zero elements and thus speed up a computation. As previously explained , TACO uses a novel scheme that describes different tensor storage formats by specifying whether each dimension is sparse or dense. A dense dimension indicates to TACO that most if not all slices of the tensor along that dimension contain at least one nonzero element. So if every element in a matrix is nonzero, we can make that explicit by storing the matrix in a format where both dimensions are dense, which indicates that every row is nonempty and that every column in each row stores a nonzero element: pytaco . format ([ pytaco . dense , pytaco . dense ]) # a.k.a. a dense array A sparse dimension, on the other hand, indicates to TACO that most slices of the tensor along that dimension contain only zeros. So if relatively few rows of a matrix is nonempty and if relatively few columns in each nonempty row store nonzero elements, we can also make that explicit by storing the matrix in a format where both dimensions are sparse: pytaco . format ([ pytaco . compressed , pytaco . compressed ]) # a.k.a. a DCSR matrix Tip Storing a tensor dimension as a sparse dimension incurs overhead that is proportional to the number of nonempty slices along that dimension, so only do so if most slices are actually empty. Otherwise, it is more appropriate to store the dimension as a dense dimension. It is easy to define custom formats for storing tensors with complex sparsity structures. For example, let's say we have a three-dimensional tensor A_{ijk} that has no empty slice along the K dimension, and let's say that each row in a slice is either entirely empty (i.e., A_{ijk} = 0 for all j and some fixed k , i ) or entirely full (i.e., A_{ijk} \\neq 0 for all j and some fixed k , i ). Following the same scheme as before, we can define a tensor format that stores dimension 2 (i.e., the K dimension) as a dense dimension, stores dimension 0 (i.e., the I dimension) of each slice along dimension 2 as a sparse dimension, and stores dimension 1 (i.e., the J dimension) of each nonempty row as a dense dimension also: pytaco . format ([ pytaco . dense , pytaco . compressed , pytaco . dense ], [ 2 , 0 , 1 ]) Using the format above, we can then efficiently store A without explicitly storing any zero element. As a rough rule of thumb, using formats that accurately describe the sparsity and structure of the operands lets TACO minimize memory traffic incurred to load tensors from memory as well as minimize redundant work done to perform a computation, which boosts performance. This is particularly the case when only one operand is sparse and the computation does not involve adding elements of multiple operands. This is not a hard and fast rule though. In particular, computing with multiple sparse operands might prevent TACO from applying some optimizations like parallelization that might otherwise be possible if some of those operands were stored in dense formats. Depending on how sparse your data actually is, this may or may not negatively impact performance. The most reliable way to determine what are the best formats for storing tensors in your application is to just try out many different formats and see what works. Fortunately, as the examples above demonstrate, this is simple to do with TACO. Parallelizing Computations By default, TACO performs all computations using a single thread. The maximum number of threads that TACO may use to perform computations can be adjusted by calling the pytaco.set_num_threads function. The example below, for instance, tells TACO that up to four threads may be used to execute any subsequent computation in parallel if possible: pytaco . set_num_threads ( 4 ) In general, the maximum number of threads for performing computations should not be set greater than the number of available processor cores. And depending on the specific computation and characteristics of the data, setting the maximum number of threads to be less than the number of processor cores may actually yield better performance. As the example above demonstrates, TACO makes it easy to try out different numbers of threads and see what works best for your application. Note Setting the maximum number of available threads to be greater than one does not guarantee that all computations will be executed in parallel. In particular, TACO will not execute a computation in parallel if it multiplies two or more sparse operands (e.g. sparse vector multiplication) or adds a sparse operand to any other operand (e.g., adding two DCSR matrices), unless the outermost dimensions of the sparse operands are stored as dense dimensions (e.g., adding two CSR matrices, which can be parallelized if the result is stored in a dense matrix); the first dimension it has to iterate over is one that is supposed to reduce over (e.g., multiplying a CSC matrix by a vector, which requires iterating over the column dimension of the matrix before the row dimension even though the column dimension is reduced over); or it stores the result in a sparse tensor format. If TACO does not seem to be executing a computation in parallel, using different formats to store the operands and result may help. By default, when performing computations in parallel, TACO will assign the same number of coordinates along a particular dimension to be processed by each thread. For instance, when adding two 1000-by-1000 matrices using two threads, TACO will have each thread compute exactly 500 rows of the result. This would be inefficient though if, for instance, all the nonzeros are stored in the first 500 rows of the operands, since one thread would end up doing all the work while the other thread does nothing. In cases like this, an alternative parallelization strategy can be specified by calling the pytaco.set_parallel_schedule function: pt . set_parallel_schedule ( \"dynamic\" ) In contrast to the default parallelization strategy, the dynamic strategy will have each thread first compute just one row of the result. Whenever a thread finishes computing a row, TACO will assign another row for that thread to compute, and this process is repeated until all 1000 rows have been computed. In this way, work is guaranteed to be evenly distributed between the two threads regardless of the sparsity structures of the operands. Using a dynamic strategy for parallel execution will incur some overhead though, since work is assigned to threads at runtime. This overhead can be reduced by increasing the chunk size, which is the amount of additional work that is assigned to a thread whenever it completes its previously assigned work. The example below, for instance, tells TACO to assign ten additional rows of the result (instead of just one) for a thread to compute whenever it has completed the previous ten rows: pt . set_parallel_schedule ( \"dynamic\" , 10 ) Since dynamic parallelization strategies incur additional overhead, whether or not using them improves the performance of a computation will depend on how evenly spread out the nonzero elements in the tensor operands are. If each matrix contains roughly the same number of nonzeros in every row, for instance, then using a dynamic strategy will likely not more evenly distribute work between threads. In that case, the default static schedule would likely yield better performance. Fusing Computations TACO supports efficiently computing complicated tensor algebra expressions involving many discrete operations in a single shot. Let's say, for instance, that we would like to (element-wise) add two vectors b and c and compute the cosine of each element in the sum. We can, of course, simply compute the addition and the cosine of the sum in separate statements: t [ i ] = b [ i ] + c [ i ] a [ i ] = pt . cos ( t [ i ]) The program above will first invoke TACO to add b and c , store the result into a temporary vector t , and then invoke TACO again to compute the cosine of every element in t . Performing the computation this way though not only requires additional memory for storing t but also requires accessing the memory subsystem to first write t to memory and then load t back from memory, which is inefficient if the vectors are large and cannot be stored in cache. Instead, we can compute the addition and the cosine of the sum in a single statement: a [ i ] = pt . cos ( b [ i ] + c [ i ]) For the program above, TACO will automatically generate code that, for every i , immediately computes the cosine of b[i] + c[i] as soon as the sum is computed. TACO thus avoids storing the sum of b and c in a temporary vector, thereby increasing the performance of the computation. Fusing computations can improve performance if it does not require intermediate results to be recomputed multiple times, as is the case with the previous example. Let's say, however, that we would like to multiply a matrix B by a vector c and then multiply another matrix A by the result of the first multiplication. As before, we can express both operations in a single statement: y [ i ] = A [ i , j ] * B [ j , k ] * x [ k ] In this case though, computing both operations in one shot would require that the multiplication of B and x be redundantly recomputed for every (non-empty) row of A , thus reducing performance. By contrast, computing the two matrix-vector multiplications in separate statement ensures that the result of the first matrix-vector multiplication does not have to be redundantly computed, thereby minimizing the amount of work needed to perform the computation: t [ j ] = B [ j , k ] * c [ k ] y [ i ] = A [ i , j ] * t [ j ]","title":"Strategies for Optimization"},{"location":"optimization.html#selecting-the-right-tensor-format","text":"TACO supports storing tensors in a wide range of formats, including many commonly used ones like dense arrays, compressed sparse row (CSR), and compressed sparse fiber (CSF).

If TACO does not seem to be executing a computation in parallel, using different formats to store the operands and result may help. By default, when performing computations in parallel, TACO will assign the same number of coordinates along a particular dimension to be processed by each thread. For instance, when adding two 1000-by-1000 matrices using two threads, TACO will have each thread compute exactly 500 rows of the result. This would be inefficient though if, for instance, all the nonzeros are stored in the first 500 rows of the operands, since one thread would end up doing all the work while the other thread does nothing. In cases like this, an alternative parallelization strategy can be specified by calling the pytaco.set_parallel_schedule function: pt . set_parallel_schedule ( \"dynamic\" ) In contrast to the default parallelization strategy, the dynamic strategy will have each thread first compute just one row of the result. Whenever a thread finishes computing a row, TACO will assign another row for that thread to compute, and this process is repeated until all 1000 rows have been computed. In this way, work is guaranteed to be evenly distributed between the two threads regardless of the sparsity structures of the operands. Using a dynamic strategy for parallel execution will incur some overhead though, since work is assigned to threads at runtime. This overhead can be reduced by increasing the chunk size, which is the amount of additional work that is assigned to a thread whenever it completes its previously assigned work. The example below, for instance, tells TACO to assign ten additional rows of the result (instead of just one) for a thread to compute whenever it has completed the previous ten rows: pt . set_parallel_schedule ( \"dynamic\" , 10 ) Since dynamic parallelization strategies incur additional overhead, whether or not using them improves the performance of a computation will depend on how evenly spread out the nonzero elements in the tensor operands are. If each matrix contains roughly the same number of nonzeros in every row, for instance, then using a dynamic strategy will likely not more evenly distribute work between threads. In that case, the default static schedule would likely yield better performance.","title":"Parallelizing Computations"},{"location":"optimization.html#fusing-computations","text":"TACO supports efficiently computing complicated tensor algebra expressions involving many discrete operations in a single shot. Let's say, for instance, that we would like to (element-wise) add two vectors b and c and compute the cosine of each element in the sum. We can, of course, simply compute the addition and the cosine of the sum in separate statements: t [ i ] = b [ i ] + c [ i ] a [ i ] = pt . cos ( t [ i ]) The program above will first invoke TACO to add b and c , store the result into a temporary vector t , and then invoke TACO again to compute the cosine of every element in t . Performing the computation this way though not only requires additional memory for storing t but also requires accessing the memory subsystem to first write t to memory and then load t back from memory, which is inefficient if the vectors are large and cannot be stored in cache. Instead, we can compute the addition and the cosine of the sum in a single statement: a [ i ] = pt . cos ( b [ i ] + c [ i ]) For the program above, TACO will automatically generate code that, for every i , immediately computes the cosine of b[i] + c[i] as soon as the sum is computed. TACO thus avoids storing the sum of b and c in a temporary vector, thereby increasing the performance of the computation. Fusing computations can improve performance if it does not require intermediate results to be recomputed multiple times, as is the case with the previous example. Let's say, however, that we would like to multiply a matrix B by a vector c and then multiply another matrix A by the result of the first multiplication. As before, we can express both operations in a single statement: y [ i ] = A [ i , j ] * B [ j , k ] * x [ k ] In this case though, computing both operations in one shot would require that the multiplication of B and x be redundantly recomputed for every (non-empty) row of A , thus reducing performance. By contrast, computing the two matrix-vector multiplications in separate statement ensures that the result of the first matrix-vector multiplication does not have to be redundantly computed, thereby minimizing the amount of work needed to perform the computation: t [ j ] = B [ j , k ] * c [ k ] y [ i ] = A [ i , j ] * t [ j ]","title":"Fusing Computations"},{"location":"pycomputations.html","text":"Specifying Tensor Algebra Computations Tensor algebra computations can be expressed in TACO using tensor index notation, which at a high level describes how each element in the result tensor can be computed from elements in the operand tensors. As an example, matrix addition can be expressed in index notation as A_{ij} = B_{ij} + C_{ij} where A , B , and C denote two-dimensional tensors (i.e., matrices) while i and j are index variables that represent abstract indices into the corresponding dimensions of the tensors. In plain English, the example above essentially states that, for every i and j , the element in the i -th row and j -th column of A should be assigned the sum of the corresponding elements in B and C . Similarly, element-wise multiplication of three tensors can be expressed in index notation as A_{ijk} = B_{ijk} \\cdot C_{ijk} \\cdot D_{ijk}. To define the same computation using the TACO Python library, we can write very similar code, with the main difference being that we also have to explicitly declare the index variables beforehand: i , j , k = pytaco . index_var (), pytaco . index_var (), pytaco . index_var () A [ i , j , k ] = B [ i , j , k ] * C [ i , j , k ] * D [ i , j , k ] This can also be rewritten more compactly as i , j , k = pytaco . get_index_vars ( 3 ) A [ i , j , k ] = B [ i , j , k ] * C [ i , j , k ] * D [ i , j , k ] Note Accesses to scalars also require the square brackets notation. Since scalars are equivalent to tensors with zero dimension, None must be explicitly specified as indices to indicate that no index variable is needed to access a scalar. As an example, the following expresses the addition of two scalars beta and gamma : alpha [ None ] = beta [ None ] + gamma [ None ] Warning TACO currently does not support computations that have a tensor as both an operand and the result, such as the following: a [ i ] = a [ i ] * b [ i ] Such computations can be rewritten using explicit temporaries as follows: t [ i ] = a [ i ] * b [ i ] a [ i ] = t [ i ] Warning TACO currently does not support using the same index variable to index into multiple dimensions of the same tensor operand (e.g., A[i,i] ). Expressing Reductions In all of the previous examples, all the index variables are used to index into both the result and the operands of a computation. It is also possible for an index variable to be used to index into the operands only, in which case the dimension indexed by that index variable is reduced (summed) over. For instance, the computation y_{i} = A_{ij} \\cdot x_{j} can be rewritten with the summation more explicit as y_{i} = \\sum_{j} A_{ij} \\cdot x_j and demonstrates how matrix-vector multiplication can be expressed in index notation. Both forms are supported by TACO: i , j = pytaco . get_index_vars ( 2 ) y [ i ] = A [ i , j ] * x [ j ] y [ i ] = pytaco . sum ( j , A [ i , j ] * x [ j ]) Reductions that are not explicitly expressed are assumed to be over the smallest subexpression that captures all uses of the corresponding reduction variable. For instance, the computation y_{i} = A_{ij} \\cdot x_{j} + z_{i} is equivalent to y_i = \\big(\\sum_{j} A_{ij} \\cdot x_j\\big) + z_i, whereas the computation y_{i} = A_{ij} \\cdot x_{j} + z_{j} is equivalent to y_i = \\sum_{j} \\big(A_{ij} \\cdot x_j + z_j\\big). Expressing Broadcasts TACO supports computations that broadcasts tensors along any number of dimensions. The following example, for instance, broadcasts the vector c along the row dimension of matrix B , adding c to each row of B : A [ i , j ] = B [ i , j ] + c [ j ] However, TACO does not support NumPy-style broadcasting of dimensions that have a size of one. For example, the following is not allowed: A = pt . tensor ([ 3 , 3 ]) B = pt . tensor ([ 3 , 3 ]) C = pt . tensor ([ 3 , 1 ]) i , j = pt . get_index_vars ( 2 ) A [ i , j ] = B [ i , j ] + C [ i , j ] # ERROR!! Expressing Transposes Computations that transpose tensors can be expressed by rearranging the order in which index variables are used to access tensor operands. The following example, for instance, adds matrix B to the transpose of matrix C and stores the result in matrix A : A = pt . tensor ([ 3 , 3 ], pt . format ([ dense , dense ])) B = pt . tensor ([ 3 , 3 ], pt . format ([ dense , dense ])) C = pt . tensor ([ 3 , 3 ], pt . format ([ dense , dense ])) i , j = pt . get_index_vars ( 2 ) A [ i , j ] = B [ i , j ] + C [ j , i ] Note, however, that sparse dimensions of tensor operands impose dependencies on the order in which they can be accessed, based on the order in which they are stored in the operand formats. This means, for instance, that if B is a CSR matrix, then B[i,j] requires that the dimension indexed by i be accessed before the dimension indexed by j . TACO does not support any computation where these constraints form a cyclic dependency. So the same computation from before is not supported for CSR matrices, since the access of B requires that i be accessed before j but the access of C requires that j be accessed before i : A = pt . tensor ([ 3 , 3 ], pt . format ([ dense , compressed ])) B = pt . tensor ([ 3 , 3 ], pt . format ([ dense , compressed ])) C = pt . tensor ([ 3 , 3 ], pt . format ([ dense , compressed ])) i , j = pt . get_index_vars ( 2 ) A [ i , j ] = B [ i , j ] + C [ j , i ] # ERROR!!

Of course, you can also manually invoke these methods in order to more precisely control when each step happens: A . compile () A . assemble () A . compute () If you define a computation and then access the result without first manually invoking evaluate or compile / assemble / compute , TACO will automatically invoke the computation immediately before the result is accessed.

Each path from the root to a leaf node represents the coordinates of a tensor element and its corresponding value. Which dimension of the tensor each level of the tree corresponds to is determined by the order in which tensor dimensions are stored. TACO uses a novel scheme that can describe different storage formats for a tensor by specifying the order in which tensor dimensions are stored and whether each dimension is sparse or dense. A sparse (compressed) dimension stores only the subset of the dimension that contains non-zero values, using index arrays that are found in the compressed sparse row (CSR) matrix format. A dense dimension, on the other hand, conceptually stores both zeros and non-zeros. This scheme is flexibile enough to express many commonly-used tensor storage formats: import pytaco as pt from pytaco import dense , compressed dm = pt . format ([ dense , dense ]) # (Row-major) dense matrix format csr = pt . format ([ dense , compressed ]) # Compressed sparse row matrix format csc = pt . format ([ dense , compressed ], [ 1 , 0 ]) # Compressed sparse column matrix format dcsr = pt . format ([ compressed , compressed ], [ 1 , 0 ]) # Doubly compressed sparse column matrix format csf = pt . format ([ compressed , compressed , compressed ]) # Compressed sparse fiber tensor format As demonstrated above, you can define a new tensor storage format by creating a pytaco.format object. This requires specifying whether each tensor dimension is dense or sparse as well as (optionally) the order in which dimensions should be stored. TACO also predefines some common tensor formats (including pt.csr and pt.csc ) that you can use out of the box. Initializing Tensors Tensors can be made by using python indexing syntax. For example, one may write the following: You can initialize a tensor by calling its insert method to add a nonzero element to the tensor. The insert method takes two arguments: a list specifying the coordinates of the nonzero element to be added and the value to be inserted at that coordinate: # Declare a sparse tensor A = pt . tensor ([ 512 , 64 , 2048 ], compressed ) # Set A(0, 1, 0) = 42.0 A . insert ([ 0 , 1 , 0 ], 42.0 ) If multiple elements are inserted at the same coordinates, they are summed together: # Declare a sparse tensor A = pt . tensor ([ 512 , 64 , 2048 ], compressed ) # Set A(0, 1, 0) = 42.0 + 24.0 = 66.0 A . insert ([ 0 , 1 , 0 ], 42.0 ) A . insert ([ 0 , 1 , 0 ], 24.0 ) The insert method adds the inserted nonzero element to a temporary buffer. Before a tensor can actually be used in a computation though, the pack method must be invoked to pack the tensor into the storage format that was specified when the tensor was first declared. TACO will automatically do this immediately before the tensor is used in a computation. You can also manually invoke pack though if you need full control over when exactly that is done: A . pack () You can then iterate over the nonzero elements of the tensor as follows: for coordinates , val in A : print ( val ) File I/O Rather than manually constructing a tensor, you can load tensors directly from file by invoking the pytaco.read function: # Load a dense-sparse-sparse tensor from file \"A.tns\" A = pt . read ( \"A.tns\" , pt . format ([ dense , compressed , compressed ])) By default, pytaco.read returns a tensor that has already been packed into the specified storage format. You can optionally pass a Boolean flag as an argument to indicate whether the returned tensor should be packed or not: # Load an unpacked tensor from file \"A.tns\" A = pt . read ( \"A.tns\" , format ([ dense , compressed , compressed ]), false ) The loaded tensor will then remain unpacked until the pack method is manually invoked or a computation that uses the tensor is performed.

The insert method takes two arguments: a list specifying the coordinates of the nonzero element to be added and the value to be inserted at that coordinate: # Declare a sparse tensor A = pt . tensor ([ 512 , 64 , 2048 ], compressed ) # Set A(0, 1, 0) = 42.0 A . insert ([ 0 , 1 , 0 ], 42.0 ) If multiple elements are inserted at the same coordinates, they are summed together: # Declare a sparse tensor A = pt . tensor ([ 512 , 64 , 2048 ], compressed ) # Set A(0, 1, 0) = 42.0 + 24.0 = 66.0 A . insert ([ 0 , 1 , 0 ], 42.0 ) A . insert ([ 0 , 1 , 0 ], 24.0 ) The insert method adds the inserted nonzero element to a temporary buffer. Before a tensor can actually be used in a computation though, the pack method must be invoked to pack the tensor into the storage format that was specified when the tensor was first declared. TACO will automatically do this immediately before the tensor is used in a computation. You can also manually invoke pack though if you need full control over when exactly that is done: A . pack () You can then iterate over the nonzero elements of the tensor as follows: for coordinates , val in A : print ( val )","title":"Initializing Tensors"},{"location":"pytensors.html#file-io","text":"Rather than manually constructing a tensor, you can load tensors directly from file by invoking the pytaco.read function: # Load a dense-sparse-sparse tensor from file \"A.tns\" A = pt . read ( \"A.tns\" , pt . format ([ dense , compressed , compressed ])) By default, pytaco.read returns a tensor that has already been packed into the specified storage format. You can optionally pass a Boolean flag as an argument to indicate whether the returned tensor should be packed or not: # Load an unpacked tensor from file \"A.tns\" A = pt . read ( \"A.tns\" , format ([ dense , compressed , compressed ]), false ) The loaded tensor will then remain unpacked until the pack method is manually invoked or a computation that uses the tensor is performed.

Each path from the root to a leaf node represents a tensor coordinate and its corresponding value. Which dimension each level of the tree corresponds to is determined by the order in which dimensions of the tensor are stored. taco uses a novel scheme that can describe different storage formats for any tensor by specifying the order in which tensor dimensions are stored and whether each dimension is sparse or dense. A sparse dimension stores only the subset of the dimension that contains non-zero values and is conceptually similar to the index arrays used in the compressed sparse row (CSR) matrix format, while a dense dimension stores both zeros and non-zeros. As demonstrated below, this scheme is flexibile enough to express many commonly-used matrix storage formats. You can define a new tensor storage format by creating a taco::Format object.
